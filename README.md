In this paper we would look at various datasets to explore the level of CO2 emissions globally, changes of temperature around the world, changes in sea level, and trends of natural disasters. We will focus on time series analysis with Facebookâ€™s Prophet Forecasting model to forecast the trends in the next few years. Prophet is a package created by Facebook for forecasting time series data based on an additive model and follows sklearn model (Prophet, 2019). The key benefit on using Prophet is its ability to handle seasonality, outliers, and missing values well and as we gather data from different organisations, this will help speed up process of forecasting by eliminating steps such as differencing when compared to traditional ARIMA modelling
